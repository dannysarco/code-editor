If you define a variable in cell #1, you can refer to it in any of the following cells! \n- You can show any React component, string, number, or anything else by calling the `show` function. This is a function built into this environment. Call show multiple times to show multiple values\n- Re-order or delete cells using the buttons on the top right\n- Add new cells by hovering on the divider between each cell\n\nAll of your changes get saved to the file you opened JBook with.
